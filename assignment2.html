<p style="font-size:8px"><i>
  The inspiration for this hypothesis came from an article written on 538 about how the 2021 class of rookie quarterbacks in the NFL were performing historically poorly.  I decided to plot a heatmap of the pass attempts of the 2021 rookies and compare them against previous classes to see how they were performing in order to test this.  Not all rookies were considered, only those players who<br>
  had started a game in their rookie season.  The previous classes of rookies were split into two classes, bust and success.  A player was put into the bust class if they hadn't played since their rookie season, had changed teams since their rookie season, or had been replaced as a starter on their team.  All other players were put into the success class.  However, there is one instance of a player <br>
  being put into the success class, yet being replaced as a starter, since this occurred due to off field issues and was not related to their play.</i></font></p>

<p style="font-size:8px"><i>The NFL has only released data consistently on games since 2017, and as such only rookies from 2017 onward are considered.  The data is also only released as images, with no raw data being given.  Therefore, it's necessary to scrape the raw data from these images.  A paper has been written, and a corresponding git hub produced, which details how to go about this.  Unfortunately, the NFL <br>
  has slightly changed the format of their images since the release of this paper, and thus some minor modifications to the data scraping code were necessary.  All pre-2021 passes had already been archived on the git hub and thus it was only necessary to scrape data from the 2021 rookies.</i></font></p>

<p style="font-size:8px"><i>After scraping the data, a probability distribution was created using kernel density estimation.  A fairly large bandwidth of 2 was chosen so as to ensure that the relative sparse 2021 rookie data was not overfit.  A large domain was also considered, 600x700, so that the data was sufficiently fine.  This data was then output in a .json format for use in VEGA.  Finally, a color scheme was chosen <br>
  so as to fulfill various requirements discussed in class, the exact spcifications of which will be elaborated further on in the graph annotation.</i></font></p>
