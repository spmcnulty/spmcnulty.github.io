<p style="font-size:8px"><i>
    Contemporary tuition and enrollment numbers were taken from various places on the websites for the University of montana
    and Montana State University, respectively umt.edu and montana.edu.  More specific links are given below.
    In order to compare tuition across many years, the dollar values were normalized to the Consumer Price Index as of August 2021.
    <br>The month used in each case was August, since that is typically when the Fall semester starts and that is the semester of interest.
    This is because fall is typically the semester of matriculation for new students.  While there was a small amount of spring semester
    data available, this was ignored for several reasons.  Spring semester enrollment is heavily influenced <br>by the lack of retention from the fall
    and is thus nearly always much less than the fall previous and next.  Due to this tuition is only updated before each Fall semester and
    the data for spring enrollment is much more sparse.  As well, since there are many different types of students, tuition was only
    considered for full-time, campus-based, undergraduates.  If there was <br>a difference between upper and lower division undergrad tuition,
    the lower division tuition was considered.</i></font></p>
