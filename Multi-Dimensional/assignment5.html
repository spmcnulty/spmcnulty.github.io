  Often in football fan communities, there is the belief that many teams, current and past, have poor offenses which appear better due to superior defenses.  This has inspired the hypothesis for this visualization, which is in a sense a null hypothesis of this claim.</i></font></p>

<p style="font-size:8px"><i>
  As can be seen using the above visualization tool, many metrics of offensive performance are correlated with metric of defensive performance, and playoff teams are regularly are superior in both cases when compared with non-playoff teams.  For example, compare points against to points for, which are extremely tightly correlated.  <br>This is perhaps the best metric to compare offenses and defenses, since it gets to the core of what the point of these positions are.  An offense is doing it's job if it scores points, and a defense is doing its job if it prevents points from being scored. </i></font></p>

<p style="font-size:8px"><i>
  While the user is invited to explore this narrative through the presentation of two variables and clear differentiation between offensive and defensive variable, they are also able to explore the dataset further as they wish, by contrasting various variable with win/loss percentage or two variables for the same side of the ball.</i></font></p>
